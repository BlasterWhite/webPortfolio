## Issues

## Pages
- Home (brief summary of all the contents of the others pages)
- Projects pages (Imge a link to the github project, skills invold)
- Contact pages (Linkeding, Adress, email and social media)
- About (Who I'am, mood, and the parcours I took)
- `(Maybe)` Skill (What I Know, where I learn it and how, convention. What tools you know, languages speak)

## Ideas
- Skills show like circular londing bar
- Div could be styled like a window
- Maybe In 2 languages ?
